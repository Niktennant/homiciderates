# Changes in Crime Rates in Major U.S. Cities

The objective of this project was to analyze changes in crime rates in major U.S. cities over the past 40 years. The research question for this project was, "How has crime changed over the past 40 years in U.S. major cities?" This topic was chosen as it was deemed interesting and potentially informative to analyze crime changes in major US cities. Additionally, there was a significant amount of data available that would allow for the creation of a meaningful and clear project.

To analyze the data, a k-means clustering algorithm was used to group cities into low, mid, and high crime clusters based on their homicide rates per 100,000 people. Data was collected from 1975, 1995, and 2014. To ensure that the data was standardized, any NaN values were dropped, and only data that was reported over a 12-month period was analyzed. This decision was made to standardize the data and to eliminate any potential outliers that may have skewed the results.
